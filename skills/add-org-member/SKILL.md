description: >
  Add a Dimagi teammate to a Connect workspace (organization) by email, so
  they can see the programs/opportunities ACE runs there. Thin wrapper over
  the `connect_add_org_member` atom: enforces a @dimagi.com guard, defaults
  the workspace to the instance's configured PM org and the email to the session's own git
  identity ("add me"), invites via Connect's membership form, and verifies
  by member-table + pending-invite-table read-back. Anyone running ACE can invoke it; ACE performs
  the add as its own org-admin identity.

# Add Org Member

Invite a human to a Connect **workspace** (Connect's term: *organization*) by
email. This is the "let me / let a teammate into ACE's workspace so they can
see what ACE is building" flow. "ACE's workspace" is the instance's configured
PM org (`connect_orgs.pm_org`, `lib/connect-orgs.ts`) — never a typed slug.

## What it does

1. Resolves inputs (see **Arguments**): `email`, `organization_slug`, `role`.
2. **Enforces the @dimagi.com guard** — refuses any email not ending in
   `@dimagi.com`. This is an internal-team tool; adding external addresses to
   a Dimagi workspace is out of scope. If the operator genuinely needs to add
   an external collaborator, that's a deliberate manual action in the Connect
   UI by an org admin, not this skill.
3. Calls `connect_add_org_member({ organization_slug, email, role })`.
4. Reports the result — including the two Connect-side preconditions if the
   add was rejected (see **Failure modes**).

## Arguments

| Input | Required | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `email` | no | the session's `git config user.email` (i.e. "add me") |
| `organization_slug` (`--org`) | no | the configured PM org — `connect_orgs.pm_org` (resolve with `bash bin/ace-doctor --preflight --no-live` → `connect_orgs.pm_org`) |
| `role` (`--role`) | no | `member` (one of `admin` \| `member` \| `viewer`) |

Resolve `email` when omitted by running `git config user.email`. If that is
empty or not a `@dimagi.com` address, ask the operator for the email rather
than guessing.

## Precondition (enforced by Connect — you cannot bypass it)

- **ACE must be an admin of the target workspace.** ACE acts as its own
  Connect identity (`ace@dimagi-ai.com`). Connect's `add_members` view is
  `@org_admin_required`; if ACE is not an admin of `organization_slug` the
  POST 403s. The atom surfaces this as an HTTP 403 error — if you see it, ask
  a current workspace admin to add `ace@dimagi-ai.com` as an admin first (or
  to add the user directly).

The invitee does **not** need a Connect account first. Connect records the add
as a **pending invite** and emails an accept-invite link; someone with no
account signs up from that link. The membership appears only once they accept
(ace#2503).

## Process

1. **Resolve + guard.** Resolve `email` (arg or `git config user.email`),
   `organization_slug` (arg, else `connect_orgs.pm_org` from
   `bash bin/ace-doctor --preflight --no-live`), `role` (arg or `member`).
   Report the resolved slug back so the operator sees which workspace it was.
   If `email` does not end in `@dimagi.com`, STOP and tell the operator this
   skill only adds Dimagi accounts; point them at the Connect UI for external
   collaborators.

2. **Add.** Call `connect_add_org_member({ organization_slug, email, role })`.
   The atom GETs the workspace home for a CSRF token, POSTs the membership
   form, then reads back BOTH the member table and the pending-invite table,
   before and after (Connect's view redirects identically on success and
   failure, so read-back is the only reliable signal — the atom handles this).

3. **Report** by the returned `status` — every one below except a throw is a
   success, and `role` is what Connect stored (read back), not what you asked:
   - `invited-pending` — the normal outcome. The invite was created and emailed;
     they appear under *Pending Invites* (`invited_on` / `expires_on` given)
     and become a member when they click the link.
   - `already-invited` — a pending invite already existed; Connect re-sends it
     unless it was sent a few minutes ago (reinvite cooldown).
   - `invited` — a membership was created directly.
   - `already-member` — nothing changed; they were already in the workspace.
   - `role_unchanged` present — the requested role did NOT land; relay its note.

   On a `ConnectValidationError` or HTTP 403, see **Failure modes**.

## Failure modes

- **`ConnectValidationError` ("recorded neither a membership nor a pending
  invite")** — the email is in neither table after the POST, so Connect
  recorded nothing. Likely an invalid address, or the reinvite cooldown on an
  invite that was just revoked/accepted. Check the workspace's Members tab.
  Do NOT tell the person to "sign in to Connect first" — that is not a cause.
- **HTTP 403** — ACE (`ace@dimagi-ai.com`) is not an admin of this workspace.
  A current admin must grant ACE admin, or add the user directly.
- **Non-@dimagi.com email** — refused by this skill before any Connect call.

## MCP tools used

- `connect_add_org_member` (ace-connect) — the only mutating call.

## Notes

- The atom is general (any workspace, any role); the @dimagi.com guard lives
  here in the skill, so the underlying capability stays reusable for future
  internal flows.
- This is not part of `/ace:run` — it's a standalone operator convenience,
  invoked via `/ace:add-org-member`.
