# Target Geographies

Where an intervention should go, who lives there, and what reaching them would
cost. This is the core query loop of the `targeting-analyst` agent; the
judgement that surrounds it — vetting a new source, defending the number,
producing the artifacts — lives in its sibling skills, and this one hands off
rather than half-doing them.

The data and arithmetic are in the Connect Labs `targeting_*` MCP tools. What
this skill carries is what those tools cannot: which question to ask, and how to
read the answer without overclaiming.

## Inputs

| Source | Artifact | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| The request | indicator, threshold(s), country scope | the query itself |
| Connect Labs MCP | `targeting_research` | what is already known about this indicator's sources and traps |
| Connect Labs MCP | `targeting_indicators` | indicator family, unit, which methods can answer |
| Connect Labs MCP | `targeting_select` | totals, ranked areas, honesty fields |
| Connect Labs MCP | `targeting_scenario` | cost basis and total |
| Phase 1 (optional) | `1-design/idea-to-pdd.md` | intervention, unit cost and pricing basis |

## Products

- `<phase>/target-geographies_summary.md` — the selection, its totals, and every
  caveat the honesty fields raised
- A handoff to `defend-a-figure` before any figure is published

## Process

1. **Read what is already known.** `targeting_research` for the indicator, first
   and always. It returns prior findings with each claim re-run against live
   data. Read `trust` before using anything: `holds` means the note describes
   reality now, `drifted` means re-derive whatever the failed checks cover,
   `unverified` means the note is a lead rather than a finding. If `rescan_due`
   is set, say so and ask the user whether to run `scan-data-sources` — the
   checks confirm what we found, they cannot tell you whether something better
   has since been published.
2. **Establish the indicator's family and unit.** Call `targeting_indicators`. A
   **burden** measure (mortality, stunting, malaria incidence) is worse when
   high and selects places *above* the threshold. A **coverage** measure
   (sanitation, ORS, immunisation, ITN use, effective treatment) is worse when
   low, selects *below*, and the fundable quantity is the **unreached count**,
   not the rate. More than half of the 29 targetable indicators are coverage
   measures — never assume. Units are not interchangeable either: mortality is per 1,000
   live births, so 8% is a threshold of 80, while 50% sanitation is 50.
3. **Check which methods can answer it.** `targeting_indicators` lists per-method
   country counts. IGME publishes mortality only; MAP's surfaces answer malaria
   only; DHS answers what it surveyed. A method showing 0 countries returns an
   empty answer, which reads exactly like "no burden here".
4. **Run `targeting_select`** for each threshold of interest, scoping with
   `iso_codes` when the question names countries.
5. **Read the honesty fields before quoting any total.** `coverage` says how many
   selected units carry each count — short of the total means the figure is a
   **floor, not a measurement**, and must be worded that way. `inherited_units`
   counts units whose rate was measured somewhere coarser — usually their
   country — and applied here; a selection that is mostly inherited is a
   national figure repeated across regions, not a subnational finding.
   `countries_unsupported` names who was left out rather than answered at
   another level.
6. **Cost it with `targeting_scenario`** when money is in the question. A unit
   price is meaningless without a unit of measure, and the basis is a property of
   the programme: KMC per newborn, a bednet per child, a water connection per
   household, an antimalarial per case. Where an indicator implies no case count
   the per-case basis is refused rather than approximated — pick another basis.
7. **Hand off before publishing.** `defend-a-figure` for anything a funder will
   read; `build-targeting-model` for a Doc and model. Do not shortcut either.
8. **Write back anything new you learned** with `targeting_research_write`,
   especially a trap or a rejected source. The next session should not have to
   find it again.

## What has counts, and why it matters

Most indicators here are rates, and a rate cannot answer "how many cases would we
be treating" — the per-case cost basis is refused rather than faked. Four
families escape that, and they are what to reach for when a programme has to be
*sized* rather than merely located:

| Count | From | Answers |
|---|---|---|
| `malaria_cases`, `malaria_deaths` | MAP 5 km surfaces, annual to 2024 | how much disease, per year |
| `antimalarial_effective_gap` | cases x (1 - effective treatment) | **untreated cases** — its denominator is a case count, not a population |
| `pop_beyond_2h` | Weiss et al. travel time x WorldPop | people further than two hours' walk from care |
| `pop_rural` | DEGURBA x WorldPop | rural population, by the UN-comparable definition |

Continental figures, for scale: 241.9M malaria cases and 116.9M of them
untreated; 242.9M people beyond two hours' walk; 745.2M rural.

## Ranking countries against each other

"Which countries should be tier 1?" is a different question from "which regions
cross a threshold?", and the tools answer it unevenly. Know this before you
start, or you will spend a dozen calls finding it out (ace#2560).

- **`resolution: national` answers only what a national method's sources carry.**
  `national_igme` is `u5mr`, `imr` and `nmr` for 54 countries (IGME 2024);
  `national_modelled` is `lbw_rate`; `national_surface` is the gridded
  MAP/access/DEGURBA layers. Ask `ors_coverage`, `exclusive_breastfeeding` or
  any other survey indicator at national resolution and you get
  `empty_because_unanswerable: true` — which is not a finding.
- **Survey indicators come from `method: subnational_survey`, which rolls a
  country up to one ADM0 row only when every region clears the threshold.** A
  country whose regions straddle the cut stays split, even at a threshold above
  `threshold_max`; read `countries_partly_above` to see which. On 2026-09-30,
  for ORS, that list held Nigeria, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Mali, Tanzania and
  fourteen others. Quote a **range across regions** for those countries,
  labelled as such; never average regions into a national figure yourself — the
  weights you would need are not in the response.
- **Rank neonatal mortality with `method: national_igme`, never the survey
  route.** Since connect-labs#2116 it answers `nmr` for 54 countries.
  `subnational_survey` still returns UNICEF's 2021 national value for only 24,
  and the two disagree by more than rounding (Zimbabwe 33.7 under IGME 2024
  against 22.8 under UNICEF 2021), so do not mix them in one ranking.
  National ORS/EBF values are still missing (connect-labs#2117).
- **Keep the calls small.** A survey select returns up to `limit` region rows at
  ~400 tokens each. For a ranking, `limit: 60` on the survey indicators is
  enough to see every whole-country row plus the split countries' regions.
- **Name the scope.** The data is the 55 African countries. A ranking request
  that does not say "Africa" may mean South Asia too — say it was not assessed
  rather than implying the list is complete.

## What this cannot answer

- **"How many villages?"** Only where somebody has already drawn them: of 55
  African countries, three reach village level — Rwanda (14,815 *umudugudu*),
  Madagascar (17,465 *fokontany*), Burundi (2,615 *collines*). Twenty-one stop at
  ward, twenty-five at district. Check `targeting_admin_levels` first. Detection
  from building footprints does not substitute: tested against Rwanda's register,
  the same buildings yield 68 or 2,403 clusters for one district depending only
  on the radius, and in Kigali one cluster absorbed 69% of the district. Where no
  register exists, reframe to *"how many delivery units of ~N households"* — well
  posed, and what a programme actually budgets.
- **Rural vs urban**, without naming the definition. DEGURBA classes 17% of
  Rwanda's villages as rural against a national figure near 72%. Both are
  defensible; a number quoted without its definition is not.
- **Anything from IHME.** Its non-commercial licence excludes for-profit entities
  and their employees and forbids re-hosting; nobody should register a
  healthdata.org account on a dimagi.com address. Report it as excluded on
  licence grounds, and note it may well be better — not that it is worse.

Each of these is recorded as a research note, so `targeting_research` returns the
current version rather than this file's.

## Mode Behavior

- **Auto:** run the queries, write the summary, hand off to `defend-a-figure`,
  notify the admin group with the headline figure and any honesty-field caveat.
- **Review:** present the selection, its totals and its caveats for approval
  before costing or handing off.
