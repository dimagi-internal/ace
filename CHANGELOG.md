# Changelog

All notable changes to the ACE plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the plugin follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-09

Initial deploy infrastructure — ACE can now be installed, updated, and
diagnosed like a first-class Claude Code plugin.

### Added

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` so ACE can be installed via
  `/plugin marketplace add jjackson/ace`. The repo root acts as both the
  marketplace and the plugin source.
- `VERSION` file as the lightweight source-of-truth for `bin/ace-update-check`.
  Must stay in lock-step with `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json`, and
  `package.json` on every release (`/ace:doctor` cross-checks them).
- `/ace:setup` — one-shot installer. Detects the plugin root, runs
  `npm install`, verifies `.gws-sa-key.json`, checks `tsx` and `.mcp.json`,
  and optionally registers a `SessionStart` hook for automatic update checks
  (`--auto-update`). Replaces the three manual README steps.
- `/ace:update` — rigid, scripted updater modelled on canopy's
  `/canopy:update`. Pulls from `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/ace`, rsyncs
  into a new versioned cache dir (excluding `node_modules` and the service
  account key, which are carried forward), runs `npm install`, updates
  `installed_plugins.json`, and tells the user to `/reload-plugins`.
- `/ace:doctor` — diagnostics command. Cross-checks version consistency,
  dependencies, the service account key, the MCP manifest, the update-check
  script, and related repos (`ace-web`, `connect-labs`). Prints PASS/WARN/FAIL
  with fix hints for each check.
- `bin/ace-update-check` — lightweight bash script borrowed from gstack. Reads
  local `VERSION`, curls the remote from `raw.githubusercontent.com`, caches
  in `~/.ace/update-check` (60-min TTL up-to-date, 720-min TTL
  upgrade-available), and respects a snooze file with escalating backoff
  (24h / 48h / 7d). Outputs `UPGRADE_AVAILABLE` / `JUST_UPGRADED` / nothing.
- `migrations/` directory and `migrations/README.md` explaining when to add
  version-to-version migration scripts for breaking changes.

### Changed

- README `Setup` section rewritten to describe the marketplace install
  followed by `/ace:setup` and `/ace:doctor`. Manual instructions are kept as
  a fallback for local dev checkouts.

### Inheritance notes

- **Canopy pattern (plugin manifest + marketplace + rigid update):** the
  update flow and marketplace layout are straight ports of canopy's approach,
  which has proven durable across 0.2.20 → 0.2.28 releases. ACE improves on
  canopy by carrying the service-account key forward across upgrades
  explicitly (canopy has no equivalent secret) and by running `npm install`
  inside the new cache dir so `node_modules` is always in sync with the
  updated `package.json`.
- **Gstack pattern (lightweight update-check + snooze):** `bin/ace-update-check`
  is a direct port of gstack's `bin/gstack-update-check`, minus the telemetry
  ping and the stale-Codex-description migration. The snooze levels (24h / 48h
  / 7d) and cache TTLs (60m / 720m) are kept identical — they're well-tuned
  and I didn't see a reason to deviate for a first cut.
